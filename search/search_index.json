It consists of 2 major components:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Vulnerability and license management system SecObserve: SecObserve provides the development team with an overview of the results of all vulnerability and license scans for their project, which can be easily filtered and sorted. In the detailed view, the results are displayed uniformly with a wealth of information, regardless of which vulnerability scanner generated them.</p> <p>With the help of automatically executed rules and manual assessments, the vulnerability results can be efficiently evaluated to eliminate irrelevant results and accept risks. This allows the development team to concentrate on fixing the relevant vulnerabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>GitLab CI templates and GitHub actions: Integrating vulnerability scanners into a CI/CD pipeline can be tedious. Each tool has to be installed differently and is called with different parameters. To avoid having to solve this task all over again, there are repositories with GitLab CI Templates and GitHub Actions. These make the process of integrating vulnerability scanners very simple by providing uniform methods for launching the tools and uniform parameters. The tools are regularly updated in the repositories so that the latest features and bug fixes are always available.</p> <p>All actions and templates run the scanner, upload the results into SecObserve and make the results of the scans available for download as artefacts in JSON format.</p> <p>The sources of the GitHub actions and GitLab CI templates can be found in https://github.com/SecObserve/secobserve_actions_templates.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"getting_started/about/#workflows","title":"Workflows","text":"<p>There are 2 main workflows when working with SecObserve:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Consuming results of vulnerability scanners: In this workflow, a pipeline runs one or more vulnerability scanners and uploads the results into SecObserve.

Project id The path of the repository in its URL in GitHub or GitLab, e.g. <code>SecObserve/SecObserve</code>. For Jira it is the key of the project. Labels A comma separated list of labels, that will be set for the issue. Additional labels can be set in the issue tracker, they will be preserved when the issue is updated. Minimum severity (optional) Issues will only be exported for observations with a severity that is higher or the same. Username (only for Jira) The REST API of Jira needs an authentication with username and API key. Issue type (only for Jira) The issue type to be created.
