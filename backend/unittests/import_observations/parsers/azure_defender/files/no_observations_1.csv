Data is encrypted automatically using platform-managed keys, so the use of customer-managed keys should only be applied when obligated by compliance or restrictive policy requirements.  To enable this recommendation, navigate to your Security Policy for the applicable scope, and update the *Effect* parameter for the corresponding policy to audit or enforce the use of customer-managed keys. Learn more in Manage security policies.Secure your storage account with greater flexibility using customer-managed keys (CMKs). When you specify a CMK, that key is used to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. Using CMKs provides additional capabilities to control rotation of the key encryption key or cryptographically erase data.","To enable customer-managed keys on your storage accounts, create an encryption key in your key vault then pass the key identifier to the storage account.
