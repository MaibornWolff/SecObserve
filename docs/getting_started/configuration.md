# Configuration

## Deployment

A part of the configuration is done with environment variables, which need to be set when deploying SecObserve. How this is done depends on the deployment method, see [Installation](installation.md).

All the `OIDC_*` environment variables are needed for technical reasons. If `OIDC_ENABLE` is set to `false`, the other `OIDC_*` environment variables can be set to `dummy` or something similar.

More about the configuration for different OpenID Connect providers can be found in [OpenID Connect authentication](../integrations/oidc_authentication.md).

## Admininistration in SecObserve

Other parts of the configuration are done in the administration interface of SecObserve under `Settings`, which can only be accessed by users with the role `Superuser`.

![Settings](../assets/images/screenshot_settings.png)

The entries shall be checked and adjusted if necessary after installing SecObserve.
