# Metrics

Metrics about observations are shown in 2 places:

* On the dashboard a user can see the aggregated metrics of the observations for all products they have access to.
* On the *Metrics* tab of a product a user can see the metrics for the observations of that product.

Metrics are calculated in an asychronous task. Per default the task is scheduled to run every 5 minutes. This default can be changed by administrators via the [Django Admin user interface](../getting_started/configuration.md#admin-user-interface).
