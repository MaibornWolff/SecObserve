# Rule engine

Sometimes the result of a scanner doesn't fit to the product's needs. Either the severity or the status need to be adjusted. To avoid having to do many manual assessments regularly, a built-in rule engine can adjust severity and/or status directly with the import of observations.

This can remove a lot of noise, for example by setting observations to `False positive`, in case the ruleset of the scanner can not be adjusted appropriately.

Rules can be managed in two ways:

* **General rules** will be applied for all products. A product can be excluded from general rules in its settings.
* **Product Rules** are only valid for one product.

These fields are used to decide if a rule shall be applied for an observation:

* **Parser** *(mandatory)*: The observation has been imported with this parser.
* **Scanner prefix** *(optional)*: The observation has been generated by a scanner which name starts with this prefix. A prefix is used here because the scanner field in the observation often contains the version of the scanner as well, which is typically irrelevant for the rule.
* **Observation title** *(optional)*: Regular expression to match the observation's title
* **Origin component name:version** *(optional)*: Regular expression to match the component name:version
* **Origin docker image name:tag** *(optional)*: Regular expression to match the docker image name:tag
* **Origin endpoint URL** *(optional)*: Regular expression to match the endpoint URL
* **Origin service name** *(optional)*: Regular expression to match the service name
* **Origin source file** *(optional)*: Regular expression to match the source file

If an observation matches all fields containing a value, than the new severity and/or new status is set in the observation and a comment is stored in the `Observation Log`.
