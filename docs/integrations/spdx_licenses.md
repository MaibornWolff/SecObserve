# SPDX licenses

The [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) gathers a list of commonly found licenses and exceptions used for open source and other collaborative software. The list is called [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) and is imported daily into SecObserve from a JSON file hosted on GitHub.

## Configuration

Per default the task to import the SPDX licenses is scheduled to run every night at 01:30 UTC time. This default can be changed by administrators via the [Settings](../getting_started/configuration.md#admininistration-in-secobserve).

Hour is always in UTC time.
